# Bill Of Materials

I used the specific components listed below, so shop and use at your own risk! 

**YOU NEED MUST SAND DOWN THE ALUMINIUM PINS TO MAKE THEM FIT** - This prevents the pins from falling out and looks cool. 
It's not that much so don't start complaining. Matching XY-Joints in STL directory.
